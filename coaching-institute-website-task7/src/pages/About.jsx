        <h2 className="section-title">Our Journey</h2>

        <p>
          BrightFuture Coaching began as a small initiative to support
          students struggling with academic concepts. Over time, with
          dedication, consistent results, and trust from parents, the
          institute has grown into a well-recognized coaching center.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the very beginning, our focus has been on understanding
          the needs of students and providing them with the right
          guidance. We believe that every student has unique strengths,
          and our role is to nurture those strengths.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our journey is driven by passion for teaching and commitment
          to student success. We continuously adapt our teaching methods

        <p>
          By promoting curiosity and critical thinking, we help students
